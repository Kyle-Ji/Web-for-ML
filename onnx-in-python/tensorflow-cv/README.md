# TensorFlow CV in ONNX Tutorial

This project needs individual conda environment to resolve the package versions conflict.

You can create a seperate conda environment via the command:

```

And then 
```Shell
conda activate tf
```

Install the Python packages with:
```Shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
